CKD doesnâ€™t usually show symptoms in its early stages. By the time signs appear, permanent kidney
damage may have already occurred. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on clinical evaluations and
lab tests, which are often done after symptoms arise. The challenge is to proactively identify
individuals at high risk by using available patient data before the disease advances. This case-study
aims to pinpoint key risk factors for CKD from a dataset of 250 randomly selected peoples. The
dataset includes both continuous (numeric) and categorical variables commonly linked to kidney
function, general health, and lifestyle.
