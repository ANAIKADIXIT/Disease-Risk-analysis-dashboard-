# Disease-Risk-analysis-dashboard-
CKD doesn’t usually show symptoms in its early stages. By the time signs appear, permanent kidney
damage may have already occurred. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on clinical evaluations and
lab tests, which are often done after symptoms arise. The challenge is to proactively identify
individuals at high risk by using available patient data before the disease advances. This case-study
aims to pinpoint key risk factors for CKD from a dataset of 250 randomly selected peoples. The
dataset includes both continuous (numeric) and categorical variables commonly linked to kidney
function, general health, and lifestyle.

Displays the average blood pressure across different CKD risk categories.
Allows filtering by blood pressure values to identify high-risk patients.
Relationship Between Blood Urea and Serum Creatinine
Scatter plot illustrating the correlation between blood urea levels and serum creatinine.
Supports insights into kidney function deterioration.
Average Serum Creatinine Across CKD Risk Categories
Line chart showing average serum creatinine values for each CKD risk category.
Helps track kidney health trends in the population.
Participant Age Distribution
Bar chart displaying the distribution of participants across different age groups.
Enables age-based risk assessment.
CKD Risk Category Proportion
